# 📖 Introduction

Campus navigation plays an important role in helping students, faculty members, staff, and visitors move efficiently across a large educational institution. As campuses continue to expand with multiple academic blocks, laboratories, libraries, auditoriums, hostels, and administrative buildings, identifying the shortest and most convenient route becomes increasingly challenging.

The **Campus Navigation System Using Graphs** is a console-based application developed in **C++** that demonstrates how graph data structures can be applied to solve real-world navigation problems. In this system, every building is represented as a **vertex**, while the roads connecting them are represented as **weighted edges**, creating a graph that models the campus layout.

By implementing graph traversal techniques such as **Breadth First Search (BFS)** and **Depth First Search (DFS)**, along with **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**, the application enables users to explore campus connectivity and determine the shortest route between any two buildings efficiently.

Apart from providing navigation functionality, the project also serves as an educational demonstration of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Graph Data Structures**, **Standard Template Library (STL)**, and **File Handling** concepts in C++.

# 📖 About the Project

Navigating through a large educational campus can be challenging, especially for new students, visitors, and faculty members. Finding the nearest route between multiple academic blocks often requires prior knowledge of the campus layout.

The **Campus Navigation System Using Graphs** is a **C++ console-based application** developed to solve this problem using the **Graph Data Structure**.

In this system:

- 🏢 Buildings are represented as **Vertices (Nodes)**
- 🛣 Roads are represented as **Weighted Edges**
- 📏 Distances are stored as edge weights

The application allows users to visualize campus connectivity, perform graph traversals, search for buildings, and calculate the shortest route between any two locations using **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Graph Algorithms**, **File Handling**, and the **Standard Template Library (STL)** through a real-world navigation application.
